✅ **Props & Component Communication** – Passing data efficiently between components  
✅ **Event Handling in React** – Handling user clicks & updating game state  
✅ **Conditional Rendering** – Displaying dynamic content based on state changes  
✅ **Lifting State Up** – Managing global game state in the main component  
✅ **CSS-in-JS & Styling in React** – Implementing responsive & modern UI  

💡 *This project was a great way to solidify my **React.js fundamentals** while working on an interactive web app!*
